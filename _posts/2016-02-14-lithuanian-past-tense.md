I just finished studying lesson 27-37 of Lithuanian Basics so I decided to write down my own notes. If you happen to know this glorious language, please correct me if you see anything wrong.

#### General Rules For Past Simple

For "o" words (verbs ending in "o" for the third person single), change the "o" into "ė". And then conjugate accordingly for other pronouns.

>jis sako (he's saying) -> jis sakė (he was saying) -> <br>
aš sakiau (I was saying) <br>
tu sakei (you were saying)

>jis daro (he's doing) -> jis darė (he was doing) -> <br>
mes darėme (we were doing) <br>
 jūs darėte (plural you were doing)

For "i" words, take the "ti" ending of the infinitive and change it to "o" (sometimes a filler consonant is necessary) and conjugate from there.

>turėti (to have) -> turėjo -> <br>
aš turėjau (I had) <br>
tu turėjai (you had)<br>
jis/ji/jie turėjo (he/she/they had)<br>
mes turėjome (we had)<br>
jūs turėjote (plural you had)<br>


#### Past Perfect

Just add a "pa" in front of the verb.

>aš dariau (I was doing) -> aš padariau (I've done) <br>
tu sakei (you were saying) -> tu pasakei (you've said)


**What's the difference?**

Think of it as the difference between *l'imparfait* and *le passé composé* in French.

>je faisais (I was doing) vs. j'ai fait (I've done)

Or the *imperfective* and *perfective* in Russian.

>я читал (I was reading) vs. я прочитал (I've read)

#### Reflective Verbs

Reflective verbs are just verbs with "si" added to the end.

Verb without "si"

> **Aš plaunu galvą** (literally I wash head) <br>
I'm washing a head

Verb with "si"

> **Aš plaunasi galvą** (literally I wash-self head) <br>
I'm washing my head

Just like in French!

> **Je lave la main** <br>
I'm washing the hand

> **Je me lave la main** <br>
I'm washing my hand
