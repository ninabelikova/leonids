I've decided to log my progress in learning iOs development. Hopefully one day when I'll have published my first app, I can look back and really appreciate the efforts I'm putting in right now (patting myself on the back much?).

While yesterday I was browsing Quora for god knows what, I stumbled upon a [thread](https://www.quora.com/iOS-Application-Development-1/What-are-the-best-resources-for-learning-iOS-development) with epic lists of iOs development resources. And one guy who answered that question has recommended his own course. That's how I discovered and bought ["iOs 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional"](https://www.udemy.com/ios9-swift/).

Then I went totally crazy about it and wasn't aware of the time before I finished lesson 27. So here's what I made today.

After you inevitably *touch* the button (I know I would), you'd see

There you are, my first ever app!



# Things absorbed:

1. How to use UIButtons, IBActions and IBOutlets.
2. How to produce cute logos in 30 seconds.
