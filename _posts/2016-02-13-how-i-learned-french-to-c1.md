I just received <s>my ultimate letter of victory</s> a letter announcing that I passed DALF C1 last week. So I thought, why not share a brief story about it? It's bound to be somewhat useful for other fellow language learners after all (I certainly hope so).

So I wrote it and posted it to reddit. Here's the post in its entirety, this time with a decent font and line height.

### The reason I decided to post this
I've always loved to read about other people's success. But the one thing I'm most curious about is what exactly they had done to achieve it. So I decided to write a summary about how I got here. Hope you'll find it useful somehow!


#### Year one: DELF B1
I used youtube videos, duolingo, various "beginner" websites to familiarize myself with basic stuff such as pronunciation, verb conjugation and some A1 vocabulary.

Then I started reading novels. At first I could only recognize the six pronouns and some conjunction words but I carried on and looked up any word necessary for me to understand what's going on while giving up on the occasional long prose. By the end of my second novel, I no longer had to skip anything. I managed to read 8 novels before the test.

For listening, I used RFI, which provides a lot of audio with transcripts. Looked up any unknown word and listened until I could fully understand it without the transcripts. 3 audios a week until the DELF test.
For speaking I would just talk to myself (so yeah the first time I ever had a real conversation in French was in the exam room. Even though I passed, this was super dumb of myself. Please don't do this). And finally for the test preparation I used the book "RÃ©ussir B1" (I think), I just went through all the exercises and mock tests.


#### Year two: DELF B2
**Reading**: I just continued reading. Lost count of how many books I've read.
**Listening**: I started using "real world" material (not made for learners) like podcasts on France Inter every day.
**Speaking**: one month before the test I found myself a tutor. I spoke with him for two hours every week. I also continued to talk to myself and record it.
**Writing**: same as the year before, I just bought a B2 preparation book and practiced writing using the exercises.


#### Year three: DALF C1
I've done pretty much the exact same thing. At this point French was just a normal part of my life, didn't feel like studying. Except this year I was finally comfortable enough to watch French youtubers (somehow this kind of unscripted, familiar French was harder than the news for me). I sat the exam last December and just received the results saying that I passed!
